    {% for item in item.contests %}
    <li {%if item.highlight!="highlight" %}x-show="highlight" x-transition{%endif%}><img
        src="{{item.img | relative_url}}" class="h-5 w-5 mr-1 -mb-1 ">
      <a class="underline" {%if item.link%} href="{{item.link}}" {%endif%}>{{item.name}}</a> {{item.date}}
      <p class="m-0">{{item.comment}}</p>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

### Contest Fails
This is really embarrassing...
<ul class="contestList">
  {% for item in page.contests_bad %}
  <li><img
      src="{{item.img | relative_url}}" class="h-5 w-5 mr-1 -mb-1 ">
    <a class="underline" {%if item.link%} href="{{item.link}}" {%endif%}>{{item.name}}</a> {{item.date}}
    <p class="m-0">{{item.comment}}</p>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## Problemsetting
Contests I set or tested:

<ul>
  {% for item in page.contests_set %}
  <li><a href="{{item.link}}">{{item.name}}</a></li>
  {%endfor%}
</ul>

      - MIT video does not do rerooting, learn how to do that after you watch
- ### Practice
  - Problems
    - [**Herriot**](https://herriot.tk/) **problem organizer**
    - [https://github.com/ac615223s5/tle](https://github.com/ac615223s5/tle) codeforce bot

    - [clist](https://clist.by/)
    - [dmoj](https://dmoj.ca/)
    - do virtual contests if live contests do not fit your schedule
- ### How to improve
  - All skill levels
    - usaco guide
    - Cp handbook/cp3 book
  - After finishing usaco guide gold (and completing most of the practice problems)
    - find a set of high quality practice problems and do random problems that are difficult for you
      - search on herriot
      - gitgud command on tle bot
      - directly searching codeforces or atcoder
      - other problem lists
    - do contests and virtual contests
      - codeforces, atcoder
  - Once you can solve problems 2100r or harder
    - read through some of the codeforces blogs and watch interesting videos for more knowledge on advanced algorithms if you want
    - Keep practicing more difficult problems
