Toothbrushes are simple devices that haven't changed much. Companies started increasing the price and adding useless features such as a thousand "whitening", "massage", and "deep clean" modes that don't do anything, or "smart" bluetooth/internet connection so it can [sell your data and get hacked](https://piped.agew.tech/watch?v=L6vLvpsrAqs). I wouldn't be surprised if there are "AI" toothbrushes now that require a phone app and subscription to work now. But instead of any of that, my new toothbrush actually uses technology to do something useful and innovative.

Intuitively, one unit of toothbrush area brushing against one unit of tooth area one time = one unit of cleaning, all else being equal. So there are a few obvious ways to improve cleaning: increase the number of brushes, increase the brushing area. You can increase the number of brushes by brushing for longer or using an electric toothbrush, but the toothbrush can't be too powerful or it will damage your teeth. You can also try changing the toothpaste and brush material/layout and using more force, but it might be hard to come up with anything better that is safe for teeth. Which leaves one option, increasing the area. For some reason, electric toothbrush heads are so tiny, and I wondered if it would be possible to brush several teeth or even use two brushes at once (after all, I have two hands). So I did some searching and found one that was interesting.

[Here it is](https://www.amazon.com/Triple-Bristle-Sonic-Blue-Brush/dp/B09PQP4DSX). The brush has 3 parts to clean all sides of the teeth at once.

Currently, it costs 38$ and comes with 2 replacement heads.

In my experience, it works great and doesn't miss any spots. It has soft bristles which is [the only type you should use](https://www.ada.org/resources/ada-library/oral-health-topics/toothbrushes/) and vibrates at around 500hz (30000 brushes/minute or 60000 strokes/minute) like most other brands. It's waterproof and you can use it in the shower.

You're normally supposed to brush for 2 minutes, so 40 seconds should be enough with 3 sides. In practice I still end up brushing for 70-90 seconds when going at a natural speed so the extra cleaning is just a bonus.

But beyond the time saving, it feels nice to use. I only have to use one arm movement for each quadrant of the mouth, and once it's in position there is less worry about getting the right angle or pressure or missing any spots. It makes brushing much simpler and frees up a little of your mind, especially if you are tired in the morning or night and in a hurry to get to school or work or bed. For someone going through mental problems, it could make the difference between brushing or not having the motivation at all.

I'm glad I discovered this toothbrush and maybe you'll like it too. I feel like too much of my blog is about computer software/programming, but that's because most people use a computer so these topics are relevant to almost everyone. If I share a new website or program I made, it's easy for you to check it out. Whereas when I talk about myself going on vacation or playing a sport, there's not much for you to discuss or take away from it. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this post. Happy moon festival, folks!
