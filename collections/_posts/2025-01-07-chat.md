Happy solstice, christmas, boxing day, new years, and any other holidays you might be celebrating! Here are some [fireworks](https://vid.stellar.afs.ovh/w/tJyDFJCB24Y4PNU2pcNBiH) to celebrate. Enjoy the new decorations!

Nievespace just reached 2 months uptime! Not much news because nothing else has happened. Which is a good thing because self-hosting is supposed to be low maintainence and convenient. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with what's become of my server.

i've also been drawing a lot recently, more will be posted on matrix soon.

there will still be more blogs but only when i think of a suitable topic. there are lots of random things i want to talk about (such as the best way to tape festive decorations to a wall) but my thoughts are too short for a blog. maybe i should do livestreams instead? hmm...

how were your holidays, did you do anything fun over the break? i'd be happy to chat in the comments/matrix discussion. otherwise, that's all for today. remember that you are valid, you are enough, you are loved. have a great 2025 ‚ù§.
