Due to videos like [this](https://piped.video/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo), a lot of people believe math is "broken" and there are mathematical "secrets" that we will never be able to prove. I wanted to share my thoughts on the matter.

Let's say I ask you:

you are taller than alice, and alice is taller than bob. Are you taller than bob?

and you can use the statements `you are taller than alice` and `alice is taller than bob` along with other properties you know about the real numbers to prove that you are taller than bob.

But what if instead I ask you:

if you are taller than alice, and alice is taller than bob, then what is your credit card number, including the digits on the back?

you might complain that it is an unfair question, because the information I gave you has nothing to do with the question. And no matter what your credit card number was, or even if you didn't have one at all, the two statements I provided you, and everything you could derive from them, would still behave the same. 

Math doesn't let you find true or false statements out of nowhere. You have to take things you already know are true or false and combine them in a particular way to prove something else. Usually, those things you already know are from a paper, textbook, taught by a professor, or taken from wherever else. At some point, they were proven by other people using things they knew beforehand, and so on, all the way until we get to the most basic statements that we declare to be true without any proof. Those are called axioms. What the incompletness theorem says is that no matter what axioms we start with, there will always be statements that don't have anything to do with these axioms. They can be either true or false without contradicting these axioms or anything that can be proven from these axioms. These will be your so called "unprovable" statements, although I think the better term is "independent of those axioms".

When you think of things such as sets or numbers, they're just concepts, not physical objects. You can prove something about the natural numbers, and once you find a real life phenomenon that they can represent, such as apples, then you can apply what you have proven to those objects as well. In real life, the statement "*I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component...*" is true, but as far as we are concerned, we could apply the math to any universe with some concept represented by alice and bob and some concept represented by height, including a universe where that statement is false. We could be more specific, and introduce another axiom that proves our independent statement either true or false. The system of axioms where it is true may be more relevant to things we do in real life, or the one where it is false, or both systems might applicable to different topics. Some statements, such as the continuum hypothesis, aren't really relevant or applicable to anything :(. So we don't care and don't introduce any new axioms unless you study in some extremely niche field where you actually need it.

You could even straight up define a true statement in a system of axioms to be one that is provably true in that system, and a false statment one that is provably false, leaving the independent statements neither true nor false. That kind of logic is known as intuitionism. You'd be removing the law of the excluded middle though, which makes things kinda weird.
