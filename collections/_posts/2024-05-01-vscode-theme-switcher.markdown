![Themes]({{"/assets/images/vsthemes.png"|relative_url}})

Visual Studio Code has many pretty themes. But when focusing on coding, I never bother to stop and pick out the right one. Vs-theme-switcher automatically chooses a theme for us so we are always greeted with a new, fresh, daylight-appropriate theme every time we open the editor.


To use the extension, simply list out all your favourite themes and decide what time of day each one should be shown at. When the time comes, a random theme will be chosen from the list. You can also specify additional commands to run to change your icons, decorations, and more.
