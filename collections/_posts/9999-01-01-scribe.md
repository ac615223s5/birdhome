Hey everyone. I set up scribe at [scribe.agew.tech](https://scribe.agew.tech/). Also Redlib now supports default filters. I will be hiding some subreddits from our instance. Obviously, it is a matter of opinion, but reddit has an algorithm to promote posts so either way someone will decide what you see by default. If you don't like it you can change it in the settings, don't take it personally. The list of filters is [here](https://codeberg.org/nieve/private-frontends-manager) and I will consider suggestions. Also I made a new dark [theme](https://codeberg.org/nieve/private-frontends-manager/src/branch/main/theme-1-piped.css) for piped. That's it.
