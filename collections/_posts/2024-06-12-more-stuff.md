Would you look at that, another post, wow.

Well, I added some new things, and now there's services for [quetre](https://quetre.agew.tech/), [proxitok](https://proxitok.agew.tech/), [rimgo](https://rimgo.agew.tech/). I dont use these often, but when I do it's nice to avoid the bloated pages and horrible ui. Nieve space expands ever further. I oughta make a map of all the districts... and finish the rest of the site, too ðŸ˜…. 

On another note, I mirrored all my repositories from Github to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/). I'm not too concerned with privacy issues since all my repositories are open source and I have the main copy stored locally. It's more of a contingency in case github ever becomes worse or wants more money from us or starts shilling copilot, or ever dares to serve me 12 captchas in a row again. 

The weather's been unbearably hot all month, but today it dropped to an amazing 15 degrees. I decided to go on a walk through the forest. Someone planted some flowers by the lake this year which was nice. I also saw bunch of waterfowl. These days the eggs have hatched and they are all too busy taking care of their children to pay attention to me. Still, it's always nice to see them. 

And yeah that's everything I have to say. I hope you have a chance this week to do something that makes you smile. Goodbye now.
