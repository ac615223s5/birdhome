A lot of the stuff from the main website will be moving in, including the pages about programming and coding contests. I realized they were actually blogs just in a different style lol. Birdhome will be renovated to fit these new additions.

I'm also planning to remove all business related content. Anyone who knows me from work or gets my resume will be directed to a separate website, separate github, separate everything. That way, this place can have whatever I want :O
