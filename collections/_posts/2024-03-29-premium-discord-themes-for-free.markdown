If you want to use the new built-in discord themes without a premium subscription, you can do so by injecting the following styles:

[discord-premium.theme.css](https://ac615223s5.github.io/discord-premium-theme/discord-premium.theme.css)

This css file can be applied using either using [Betterdiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) or in the browser using [Firemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firemonkey/).
