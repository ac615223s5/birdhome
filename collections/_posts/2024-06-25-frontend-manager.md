Everything has been well in nieve space so far, but at some point the services will reach max capacity or go down. Luckily, there are many other instances all over the internet that we can turn to when this happens. I made a [userscript](https://codeberg.org/nieve/private-frontends-manager) that not only redirects you to an alternative frontend, but detects if the instance is down and takes you to another one. It also lets you add your custom userscript that will run on all instances of a service. <span class="text-xs">With so many redundant servers, we are sure to achieve ten billion glorious years of uptime. Long live the empress!</span>
