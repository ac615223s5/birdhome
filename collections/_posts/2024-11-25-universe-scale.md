Our everyday experience of lengths starts at about 1 cm: objects far smaller than a human, but big enough to move with our hands and fingers, such as marbles, coins, forks, spoons, cups, keyboard keys, small animals. Beyond that, things start getting hard to carry in a bag, or at all. Starting from 1 meter are “large” animals/objects. Then we get to trees, skyscrapers, and mountains, but I am more familiar with lengths above 100 meters as distances from one place to another. Continuing on, we get through walking distance, driving distance, and finally flying distance. A flight across the world is about 20000 km.

So 1cm to 10000 kilometers is the human scale, a factor of a billion. Scaling everything down by 1 billion gets us the range of “small science stuff we can’t see”. Atoms and molecules are 1 billion times smaller than household objects. From 10 nm \- 1 um, things that come to mind are viruses. Computer hardware such as transistors and grains on hard drives are also at this level, equivalent to the distance of a short walk. Above that are cells, particles and fibers of various sizes such as clay and sand, silk and hair. Scaled up, this is equivalent to the sizes of cities, states, and countries. It’s hard to see anything smaller than 100 um.

Another factor of a billion brings us down to the subatomic range. The atomic nucleus is tiny. Scaled up, the nucleus in an atom would be like a single town on the surface of Jupiter. Also technically these atoms and subatomic particles don’t really have a size and what we are measuring is just the distance they interact with each other from.

And below that there is a whole lot of nothing. At 1e-35 meters is the Planck length which people like to think of as the “resolution” of the universe but that’s not true, we just do not know the physics of what happens at this scale.

1 billion centimeters is almost the diameter of earth. If the earth and small planets were represented by small fruits, then medium and large planets are medium and large fruits, and the sun is a fruit shrub. If you’ve watched one of those star size comparison videos the sun might seem like a very small star, but 95% of stars are actually even smaller than the sun. On this scale the distances between the planets are like the distance to your nearest walmart walgreens target best buy. Beyond that are some distant comets and a lot of empty space. The size of the  solar system vs distance to nearby stars is similar to the nucleus inside the atom; about a factor of 30000, or square root of 1 billion.

It’s easy to think of planets and stars and galaxies as all “big space stuff”, but at 1 billion earth diameters we have barely reached one light year. Interstellar distances are on a whole other level. If one light year was scaled to one centimeter, then galaxies would be 100 m to 10 km across. These galaxies form clusters and superclusters and finally filaments with a size around 1 billion light years. These filaments are spread evenly across the observable universe, about 100 billion light years in diameter.

What about time? 1 second is usually the shortest time, although if you are a mega pro elite gamer then even 1 ms is sometimes relevant. 1 day is about 86000 seconds and 1 year is about 30 million seconds. A century is about 3 billion seconds.

1 billion billion seconds is 33 billion years, longer than the universe has existed. How did we hit the end already? Well, humans travel about a billion times slower than light, so our sense of time is “skewed up” by about one billion compared to our sense of distance. In 1 nanosecond, light travels 30 cm, reaching the human scale.

Energy density is another interesting scale. Particles in the air move at the speed of sound, while humans move a lot slower. So kinetic energy tends to be insignificant compared to thermal energy, and that’s why we don’t heat up a cup of tea by stirring it. Water has a high thermal capacity of 4180 j/kg/k, and you would need to throw the water at 100 m/s or drop it from 400 meters to heat it by 1 degree.

The best lithium ion batteries today contain 200 watt hours or 1.4 mj per kg. Boiling water requires 2.2 mj/kg, equivalent energy to heating it over 500 degrees. Chemical reactions can create even more energy. Burning methane provides 55 mj/kg, enough energy to heat it thousands of degrees or get it moving over 10 km/s. Which is pretty much what happens in a bomb or rocket.

Then we get to nuclear processes which are a million times more energetic. That’s as much energy as matter at billions of degrees or moving a significant fraction of the speed of light. Comparable to the speed of fast neutrons or the temperature inside the core of a massive star, which is also what you’d expect.
