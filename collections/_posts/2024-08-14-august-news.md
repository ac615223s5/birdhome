## Site retheming

I decorated the website! Do you like it?

Birdhome no longer uses the default Minima theme for Jekyll. While it's great for quickly setting up blogs, I want to embrace the process of customizing my website and making it look pretty.

## Nitter
I'm hosting Nitter, even though it's technically [discontinued](https://status.d420.de/rip) since twitter started requiring an account to see anything. All the more reason to set up my own and contribute to the total bandwidth. It's public because if only one person is using it and it's logged in as an account, that's not very anonymous, is it? 

If you use this instance regularly, I would ask you to create a new twitter account yourself and send me the login information to add to our pool (contact info is at the side or bottom of the page). That way, you help increase our capacity and still get to access twitter content without signing in.

## Proxigram

There's also a proxigram instance now, at [proxigram.stellar.afs.ovh](https://proxigram.stellar.afs.ovh/). Some resturants and organizations put all their information on instagram for some reason so now you can see it without an account. Remember how I didn't understand docker images? Well this time the image was [broken](https://codeberg.org/proxigram/proxigram/issues/42), so I had to build my own. Luckily, it's easy. From what I understand, I take all the commands I would normally run to start the program and put them in the Dockerfile in a specific format. Here's a decent tutorial: [Learn Docker in 7 Easy Steps](https://piped.stellar.afs.ovh/watch?v=gAkwW2tuIqE).

## Switching to VSCodium

I started using [vscodium](https://vscodium.com/) instead of vscode because apparently this is the version that's actually open source. It was easy to switch, I just copied over my extensions from `.vscode/extensions` to `.vscode-oss/extensions` and my settings from `Code\User` to `VSCodium\User`. I'm not working on C# so everything worked the same. And yeah, that's it.


## Matrix room

I set up a [room](https://matrix.to/#/#duckgalaxy:matrix.org) on Matrix. You can use it to post comments about the blogs or other related discussion.
