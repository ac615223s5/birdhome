After months of incubation inside a virtual machine, Pepperbox now runs on its own dedicated hardware! With 2 old processor cores, 8gB of memory, and 256gB of storage, it's not the most impressive system, but on the bright side it does have its own ~~battery~~ uninterruptible power supply. And hey, how much memory did you have as a baby? 

By the way, my server is called Pepperbox because when I was installing linux I set my user account name to `pepper` and then Virtualbox automatically appended `box` to it as the name of the system.

> Does that mean you're going to start using linux regularly now

Nope. Linux's drivers for the touchpad are still considerably worse than microsoft precision drivers, and touchscreen support is even worse.

With its own body, Pepperbox can have much higher uptime and won't be taking up my video memory if I want to run a big neural network. It'll also no longer be a [container of containers](https://piped.agew.tech/watch?v=PivpCKEiQOQ&t=0).

More updates to come. Y'all have a good day now.
