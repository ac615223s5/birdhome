So uh, the site got updated. First, I added a bunch of pages and made some new ones, but then I decided to move the widgets out into their own website again. This website will be for blogs and other posts, and the other legacy widgets will be in the museum. But if I want to make a new blog that includes an interactive program... I'll just add the blog here. So I guess the museum is just an archive? Sorry if this sounds confusing, it confuses me too.

I also did some decorating and moved the navigation bar to the right. Since it's hard to read very long lines of text, all the posts are limited in width. On a 4k screen, the post ends up only taking about 30% of the screen width, so all the extra unused space on the side is perfect for adding other elements. 

I installed tailwind css alongside jekyll and alpine to help with my styling. I'll call it the chamomile stack, cause during setup I was drinking chamomile tea. I'm really liking it so far. It's great for websites that don't have user generated content (for that, my preference so far is Vue with a separate backend API).

## Web Hosting

I set up my own server "Pepperbox" and started hosting some websites. I was a little scared to use docker but it was actually quite simple. I've started off with [searxng](https://stellar.agew.tech/) and [redlib](https://redlib.agew.tech/) but there will be more in the future. I like the idea of building my own sovereign web "territory" that I can use for a variety of services.

Daylight has been getting real long lately, and today I saw the sun is up past 22. It's crazy how we still aren't at the solstice yet. I hope you are enjoying the summer. Have a good weekend!
