## Weird nitter issue (everything is breoik)
Nitter has a weird [issue](https://github.com/sekai-soft/guide-nitter-self-hosting/issues/13) that causes it to break every time the container is forcefully killed. I haven't looked into the code and don't know how to fix it but it should happen less now that pepperbox is on its own hardware. Also Piped has a strange problem with the video player. The video data is still being retrieved and it's not getting blocked by youtube, the videos are just not playing. Not to worry, I've got a [pull request](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped/issues/3715) that'll get things fixed up soon. Also, proxigram is completely broken: [#55](https://codeberg.org/proxigram/proxigram/issues/55) [#53](https://codeberg.org/proxigram/proxigram/issues/53). And proxitok is [not working quite right](https://github.com/pablouser1/ProxiTok/issues/213) either. London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down...
