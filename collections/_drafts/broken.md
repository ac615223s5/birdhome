## Weird nitter issue (everything is breoik)
Nitter has a weird [issue](https://github.com/sekai-soft/guide-nitter-self-hosting/issues/13) that causes it to break every time the container is killed. I haven't looked into the code and don't know how to fix it but it should happen less now that pepperbox rarely has to restart. Also Piped has a strange problem with videos not playing. The video data is still being retrieved so it's probably not a problem with the backend or getting blocked by youtube, and I wasn't able to reproduce it in the development build so I don't know how to fix it. Check [github](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped/issues/3715) for more information and workarounds. Also, proxigram is completely broken: [#55](https://codeberg.org/proxigram/proxigram/issues/55) [#53](https://codeberg.org/proxigram/proxigram/issues/53). And proxitok is [not working quite right](https://github.com/pablouser1/ProxiTok/issues/213) as well. London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down...
