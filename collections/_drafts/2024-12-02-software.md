### Taskbar (windows)

### Fluent search (windows)
[Fluent search](https://github.com/adirh3/Fluent-Search/) is a good alternative to the start menu that lets you search apps, settings, browser history, search engines and more. It has a calculator built in and uses its own file indexer that can efficiently search all files on the system. You can configure shortcuts and tags to quickly filter down the results and find exactly what you need.

### Everything (windows)
If you just want to search files, you can use [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/). It also uses its own file indexing that efficiently searches the whole system.

### Linux
Unfortuntely there isn't a good alternative on linux. I tried [albert](https://albertlauncher.github.io/) but it wasn't quite as easy to use as fluent search.
