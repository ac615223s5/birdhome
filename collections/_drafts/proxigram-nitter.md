## Proxigram

There's a proxigram instance now, at [proxigram.agew.tech](https://proxigram.agew.tech/). Some resturants and organizations put all their information on instagram for some reason so now you can see it without an account. Remember how I didn't understand docker images? Well this time the image was [broken](https://codeberg.org/proxigram/proxigram/issues/42), so I had to build my own. Luckily, it's easy. From what I understand, I take all the commands I would normally run to start the program and put them in the Dockerfile in a specific format. Here's a decent tutorial: [Learn Docker in 7 Easy Steps](https://piped.agew.tech/watch?v=gAkwW2tuIqE).

## Nitter
I'm also hosting Nitter now, even though it's technically [discontinued](https://status.d420.de/rip) since twitter started requiring an account to see anything. Still, all the more reason to set up my own. If you use this instance regularly, I would ask you to create a twitter account yourself and send me the login information to add to our pool (contact info is at the bottom of the page). That way, you help increase our capacity and still get to access twitter content without signing in.
