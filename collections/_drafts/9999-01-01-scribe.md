Hey everyone. I set up scribe, at [scribe.agew.tech](https://scribe.agew.tech/). Also I made a new dark [theme](https://codeberg.org/nieve/private-frontends-manager/src/branch/main/theme-1-piped.css) for piped.

## Uptime monitoring (everything is breoik)

Nitter has a weird [issue](https://github.com/sekai-soft/guide-nitter-self-hosting/issues/13) that causes it to break every time the container is forcefully killed. I haven't looked into the code and don't know how to fix it but it should happen less now that pepperbox is on its own hardware. Also Piped has a strange problem with the video player. The video data is still being retrieved and it's not getting blocked by youtube, the videos are just not playing. Not to worry, I've got a [pull request](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped/issues/3715) that'll get things fixed up soon. Also, proxigram is completely broken: [#55](https://codeberg.org/proxigram/proxigram/issues/55) [#53](https://codeberg.org/proxigram/proxigram/issues/53). And proxitok is [not working quite right](https://github.com/pablouser1/ProxiTok/issues/213) either ðŸ˜¦. London bridge is falling down.

I set up a [uptime monitor](https://status.agew.tech/status/status) where you can check whether everything's working or down.

Some news from the rest of the world:

## Firefox adds vertical tabs

Firefox added an option showing tabs in a vertical list. That means the tabs will be listed in a panel on the side of the browser rather than the top. I do like this idea, but only if the whole "chrome" area is moved vertically. As of now, it still has 3 rows: one for the bookmarks, one for the address and extensions, and one for the tabs/exit button. So the current implementation doesn't even reduce the number of rows while slicing off yet another section of your screen. At least move the bookmarks to the sidebar as well.
