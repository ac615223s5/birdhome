Hey everyone. I set up scribe, at [scribe.agew.tech](https://scribe.agew.tech/). Also I made a new dark [theme](https://codeberg.org/nieve/private-frontends-manager/src/branch/main/theme-1-piped.css) for piped. And now, the weather:

Nieve space has always been covered by fog and overcast, but today, we are 100% cloud-free! That's right, I did a little dance and blew away the rain. Also, I removed cloudflare tunnel and replaced it with [Boring Proxy](https://boringproxy.io/) running on a microsoft azure VPS. Now you might be wondering why I removed cloudflare only to use another big corporation, but I don't have control over my router and would rather not expose my network even if I could forward ports. So that means either using an external datacenter or TOR (as a hidden service). The benefit is that with Boring Proxy the TLS terminates locally, meaning that unlike with cloudflare, your HTTPS traffic never gets decrypted until it reaches my local machine. Also, I am no longer forced to use cloudflare's domains or nameserver (DNS). Unfortunately, the VPS costs money, and the net revenue for these websites is exactly zero. I have enough free azure credit to last for a couple of years, and we'll see what happens after that. Fly high, and may the sun shine on us all.

What better time to create a weather station. I set up a [status monitor](https://status.agew.tech/status/status) where you can check the uptime and see whether everything's working.

## Weird nitter issue 

Nitter has a weird [issue](https://github.com/sekai-soft/guide-nitter-self-hosting/issues/13) that causes it to break every time the container shuts down ungracefully. I haven't looked into the code and don't know how to fix it but it shouldn't happen very often. ~~Also Piped has a strange problem with the video player. The video data is still being retrieved and it's not getting blocked by youtube, the videos are just not playing. Not to worry, I've got a [pull request](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped/issues/3715) that'll get things fixed up soon~~ It got fixed. Also, proxigram is completely broken: [#55](https://codeberg.org/proxigram/proxigram/issues/55) [#53](https://codeberg.org/proxigram/proxigram/issues/53). And proxitok is [not working quite right](https://github.com/pablouser1/ProxiTok/issues/213) either ðŸ˜¦. 

Some news from the rest of the world:

## Firefox adds vertical tabs

Firefox added an option showing tabs in a vertical list. That means the tabs will be listed in a panel on the side of the browser rather than the top. That's great, it will make better use of the screen space while fitting in with my vertical taskbar and birdhome's vertical navigation bar. Except... the top panel (also known as the "chrome") didn't get any smaller. There's still 3 rows: the bookmarks, the address field, and the one with the exit button. There could have been a bookmarks section to the side and only left one row at the top. But now the sidebar is just taking up more space for nothing. How did they mess this up...
