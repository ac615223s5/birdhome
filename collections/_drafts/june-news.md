## Firefox adds vertical tabs

Firefox added an option showing tabs in a vertical list. That means the tabs will be listed in a panel on the side of the browser rather than the top. I do like this idea, but only if the whole chrome is moved vertically. As of now, it still has 3 rows: one for the bookmarks, one for the address and extensions, and one for the tabs/exit button. So the current implementation doesn't even reduce the number of rows while slicing off yet another section of your screen. At least move the bookmarks to the sidebar as well.
