I set up proxigram, at [proxigram.agew.tech](https://proxigram.agew.tech/). Remember how I didn't understand docker images? Well this time the image was [broken](https://codeberg.org/proxigram/proxigram/issues/42), so I had to build my own. Luckily, it's easy. Basically, you take all the commands you would normally run to start the program, and put them in the Dockerfile. [Here's a tutorial](https://piped.agew.tech/watch?v=gAkwW2tuIqE).

Also, I added [matrix](https://joinmatrix.org/) and [Simplex](https://simplex.chat/) to my contact links for secure communication. These days, email is really outdated technology.
